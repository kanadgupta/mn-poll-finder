# MN Precinct Finder

> (temporarily titled MPLS 2021 Poll Finder)

This project includes a Node.js server script and a web page that connects to it, along with several helper functions to retrieve the necessary precinct data. The server returns info to the page that allows it to update the display with the precinct information. üó≥Ô∏è

It also returns JSON data if the `format=json` query parameter is passed, or if the `Accept` header of the request specifies JSON.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) is a popular runtime that lets you run server-side JavaScript. This project uses the [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) framework and explores basic templating with [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/).

## Prerequisites

You'll get best use out of this project if you're familiar with basic JavaScript. If you've written JavaScript for client-side web pages this is a little different because it uses server-side JS, but the syntax is the same!

## What's in this project?
